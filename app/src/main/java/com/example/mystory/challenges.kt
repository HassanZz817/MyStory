// this function remove the last char from the string
/* fun deleteLastChar( word: String):String {

 // we want to have the string length so we use the var .length propriety
 val wordLength = word.length

 // afterward we use the substring method which have to parameters the start index and the ending index
 we start from the index zero as we don't want ot delete the first Char if that the case we would change 0 to 1
 and we end at -1 so it's always the last Char no Matter how long the String Is.
   return word.substring(0,wordLength -1)
